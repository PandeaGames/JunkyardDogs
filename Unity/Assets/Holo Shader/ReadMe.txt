Thank you for purchasing Holo Shader! Here is some information to achieve various effects
to use in your projects.

DIFFUSE - Use a texture (preferably semi-transparent) to give additional effects to your object.
	  Project includes a scanline diffuse, but feel free to use whatever you want!

NORMAL - Holo Shader supports normal maps. This is a great way to achieve detail without the
	 use of a diffuse texture. Great for ghostly effects. Project includes a brick normal map.

Y AXIS - This changes the axis in which the scanlines move. Y (up to down) or X (left to right)

SCANLINE SPEED - This dictates how fast the scanlines move. Use negative values to change direction.

SCANLINE DENSITY - How many scanlines appear on the object. Using "0" will display none.

SCANLINE EXP - The exposure of the scanlines. How bright you want them to appear.

SCANLINE OPACITY - How transparent you want the scanlines to appear.

OBJECT OPACITY - How transparent you want your entire model to appear.

DESAT. AMOUNT - Control the desaturation of the object. Can help coloured diffuse textures
		appear clearer. "0" = full colour, "1" = monochrome (note, it will be tinted by
		the hologram colour).

BRIGHTNESS - How bright you want the overall object to appear (use this to control bloom
	     on HDR effects).

COLOR - The overall tint of the hologram.

COLOR INTENSITY - The amount of colour saturation on the object.

FRES. INTENSITY - Adjust the amount of fresnel influence (inner edge glow).

INTERSECT ATTENUATION - This is used to adjust the amount of glow around the area of an
			intersecting object.

INTERSECT BRIGHTNESS - How bright the intersecting glow appears.

STATIC INTENSITY - Control the amount of static that appears on the shader. 0 = none, 1+ = full
		   This is great to add some various effects to your hologram, works great 
		   alone or mixed in with scanlines.
