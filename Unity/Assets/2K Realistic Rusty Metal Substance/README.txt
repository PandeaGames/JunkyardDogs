Thank you for your download!

With your purchase you acquired a realistic rusty metal substance (2K resolution) that you can use without limitation in your Unity projects.

If you want to see a demo of the set, go inside the folder "Scenes" of this package and open the included scenes. 

If you liked the package please leave a good feedback on the store, it is very important for me to keep on working for the community. If you have any request or idea to suggest feel free to contact me by mail: alessioregalbuto@outlook.com
